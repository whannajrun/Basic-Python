# Notes
I take the study case from many learning sources, did some customizations to make it more relatable with the material, and answer it with my own approach (because it is basically my learning journey so it will represent how i solve the problem). You can see the source (where i get the case) from disclaimer which i put on the top of each file comment/description.
